# SpringMVCFilmCRUD

## Overview

This project utilizes the Spring model-view-cotroller (MVC) framework to produce a locally hosted web application. The application leverages Spring's DispatcherServlet to dispatch requests from the client to handlers with configured mappings. These controllers depend on an @autowired Database Access Object to interact with a local MySQL server. The application is capable of creating, updating, and deleting films records in the database. This program also features a user friendly interface, which allows the user to easily choose how they want to interact with the database and what information to access, change, or delete.
